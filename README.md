# NYC Taxi Data Analysis with Apache Spark

This project analyzes NYC's taxi journey data using Apache Spark. The study explores ride patterns, trip durations, and borough-wise distribution of trips through Spark DataFrames and SQL queries. 

### Features:
- Data loading and preprocessing from Parquet and CSV files.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on trip durations and pickup/dropoff locations.
- Aggregations and visualizations to uncover trends in taxi journeys.
- Performance optimization using Spark's distributed processing.

### Technologies Used:
- **Apache Spark** (PySpark)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for additional data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)

### Data Source:
The dataset includes **NYC Yellow Taxi trip records** from January 2024, provided in Parquet format, alongside a taxi zone lookup table in CSV.
